I also thought it would be a nice idea to make a little live demo, just to see it work faster:

I did use the PHPUnit library to test it out.

What I'm Pleased With
I'm pleased with how well it works. And in my opinion it is pretty efficient, maybe a little bit more efficient than dijkstra. It's great for normal size grid's, if we look at massive grid's, I think maybe some improvements would be needed, to scale up the efficiency.

What I Would Have Done With More Time
Added comments, optimised the code a bit more, made the variables with better names. But as a technical challenge I think it's ok at what stage it is now. I can always improve it.
